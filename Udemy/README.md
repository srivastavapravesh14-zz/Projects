### This folder contains the corresponding jupyter notebook for implementing deep learning models.

The files are in the form of jupyter notebook in which models are trained and tested for the dataset.
The projects done are part of the course **"Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks"**.

The files uploaded corresponds to: -

1. Artificial Neural Network for Binary classification problem.
2. Convolutional Neural Network Model.
3. LSTM model for stock price predictions.
4. Self Organizing Maps
5. Autoencoders and Boltzman Machine


> #### Note
> The files are being uploaded once the work is finished. 
>
>More files will be uploaded once the work for other topics is completed.
>
>Notebooks are from Google Colab, hence a mounted drive might appear.
